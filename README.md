# Guessing-Game

This is a simple guessing game made with JavaScript, utilizing prompts the game takes you through questions about me, and prints a ordered list with the amount of correct guesses at the end of the quiz.

## Getting Started

There are no dependencies for this project, just have a usable Text-editor and simply clone down this repository and run it in the browser. I like using the Live-server extension for Atom and VsCode to run my code on a built-in server. 

## Running the tests

This was not made with TDD, However, it keeps track of correct answers and guesses in the console.
